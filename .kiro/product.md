# Product Context: Shahapur Sahayak (Safety & Economy Guide)

## 1. THE SAFETY INDEX (Highway Accident Prevention)
> *Goal: Prevent accidents on the Mumbai-Nashik Highway crossing.*
- **Danger Zone A:** "Kinhavali Junction".
  - **Risk:** High-speed trucks from the flyover blindspot.
  - **Rule:** If the user is walking, NEVER suggest crossing here. Route them to "Subway 2" (add 4 mins walk).
- **Danger Zone B:** "Petrol Pump Cut".
  - **Risk:** No traffic signal.
  - **Rule:** Warning: "Wait for a clear gap of 200m before crossing."

## 2. THE SMART BASKET (Economic Protection)
> *Goal: Save user money while keeping local Kirana stores alive.*
- **Logic:** D-Mart is great for bulk, but Kirana is better for daily needs.
- **Category: BULK BUY (Send to D-Mart)**
  - Items: Oil (>2L), Sugar (>2kg), Detergents, Shampoos, Biscuits (Family Pack).
  - *Reason:* Deep discounts (approx 15% saved).
- **Category: DAILY BUY (Send to Local Kirana)**
  - Items: Milk, Bread, Eggs, Cigarettes, Loose Rice (<2kg).
  - *Reason:* D-Mart queues take 45 mins; Kirana is instant. Kirana offers credit (Udhari).

## 3. TRANSPORT RULES (The "No-Uber" Reality)
- **Share Auto:** Cost ₹20/seat. Only runs till 8:30 PM.
- **D-Mart Parking Hack:** On Sundays, do NOT park inside D-Mart. Park at "Hotel Sai Garden" (adjacent plot) to avoid the 1-hour jam.
